    <section>
        <p>I am Prafful Patel. I am a current graduate student at the Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago.</p>

        <p>  Due to my strong analytical and logical skills, I have decided to pursue a bachelor's degree in Computer Science.
            Where I learned about SQL, Python, Object Oriented Programming Language, and Cloud Computing and created two 
            projects.
        </p>
    
        <p> After my bachelor’s I have been in the field of Data Analytics and Business Intelligence for 2 years in Capgemini 
            as a Senior Analyst and I specialize in Extracting and analyzing data using SQL queries and then visualizing those 
            insights using PowerBI and Tableau to make vital decisions for the organization. I have worked on various projects
            which included Report generation and analysis, Query Optimization and Cost Optimization, and dealing with 
            Cloud Computing Technologies like AWS.
        </p>
    
        <p> While working at Capgemini I realize I can expand my knowledge which will help me to grow my career in the future 
            in the field of Data Analytics. So, I decided to pursue a master’s degree.
        </p>
    
        <p> Currently, I am pursuing a Master’s in the field of Data Analytics and Management from the Illinois Institute of 
            Technology where I am learning about Data Warehousing, Data Mining, Advance Data Analytics, Advance Database 
            Management systems, and Cloud Computing.
        </p>
    
        <p> My real strength is to truly understand what information we want from the data and to create valuable insights 
            from it. Team player, Dedicated and Confident is the best words to describe me.
